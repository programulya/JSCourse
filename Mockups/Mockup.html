                The editor understands your code, its structure and offers you code completion that you expect.
                Full coding assistance is offered even for language mixtures such as HTML inside JavaScript strings.
                Hundreds of language specific code inspections analyse the whole project as you type and show you
                the identified problems before you open the browser. Intelligent quick-fixes offer instant solutions.

            <h2>FAQ</h2>
            <dl>
                <dt>Can I run my license on multiple computers, on my home machine and a t work?</dt>
                <dd>
                    You can install the software on as many machines as you like, but you can use it only on one of them
                    concurrently.
                    This means you need as many licenses as the maximum number of concurrent usages will be – so for X
                    number of users,
                    you will need X licenses.
                </dd>
                <dt>When will I receive my license after making an online payment?</dt>
                <dd>
                    We usually process orders within one business day and send the license key certificate
                    electronically.
                    We check and verify all orders manually so this can cause a delay in receiving your license.
                    If you did not receive your license certificate, please check your email spam folder.
                    The longest you wait is 48hrs from the receipt of the payment.
                </dd>
                <dt>Can I use my license for work and commercial projects?</dt>
                <dd>
                    Yes. Personal licenses are registered to the individual that purchased the license and can be used
                    for both
                    commercial and non-commercial work as long as it is paid for with your own funds. Personal licenses
                    are
                    non-transferable and can only ever be used by the license.
